# Valheim Mods
Hey bois, just go up to the green Code button, click the down arrow, choose Download Zip and save it someplace. Then all ya gotta do is unzip it into your **C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim\BepInEx** (or wherever your stupid installation is)

I'll keep this repo up to date as the mods get updated. If you wanna get real slick you could install Git on your 'puter and set up a batch file to download the stuff and move it into the place automatically. 

Also, feel free to commit to this shiz if you wanna add stuff or change a config file.
